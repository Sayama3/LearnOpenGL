# LearnOpenGL

An OpenGL Renderer I'm making. The second one as the architecture of the first wasn't to my liking.

## Requirement

To run the project, you must have OpenGL 4.3+ and C++ 20+.

## Run Build

To run a build, you can directly run one of the pre-build release _(In the GitHub action.
Soon to be released on the GitHub Releases section)_.

To correctly run the build, you must have the following architecture :

```text
resources/
├─ shaders/
│  ├─ shader.frag
│  ├─ shader2.frag
│  ├─ shader.vert
├─ textures/
│  ├─ container.jpg
OpenGL.exe
```

## Demo
Here is an example of the current state of the project.
